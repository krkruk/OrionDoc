The Hardware Control Panel (HCP) is the local simplified user interface mounted directly on the rover. 
The device is to be used by the local operator to transport and activate chosen parts of the rover without the presence of the base station and wireless connectivity. 
It provides the basic functionality required to drive the rover using a tethered joystick, fold and unfold the arm and perform basic system diagnostics. 
Such a device greatly simplifies the aspects of transporting and on-the-spot management of the rover.

The hardware of the HCP includes:
- a 4x16 alphanumeric Liquid Crystal Display with backlight,
- four LED, 
- four buttons for operating the menu,
- a tethered one-hand thumb joystick with two axes and two buttons.

The device can be used to issue the following commands
- Safe powerdown
- Fold the manipulator for transport
- Unfold the manipulator to the working position
- Fetch diagnostics data 

The data displayed on the LCD of the HCP includes but in the future should not be limited to 
- Battery voltage, temperature and level
- Wireless connection status, including range or similar metric that can be used to determine the quality, load or bandwidth of the connection
- Error messages generated due to malfunctions
- The four blinking LED can be used to signal errors, low battery or connection status 

The thumb joystick provides two axes and two buttons for driving the rover without the base station. 
One monstable button should remain pressed during all the driving process to ensure that the rover stops when the controller is accidentally dropped or disconnected.
